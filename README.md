# loveQuotesScrapper

Used to fetch 3000 quotes from https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/love. The website advertises 82k quotes but only 3k are displayed on the website. The website has false advertising by listing 82k. 

You can change the URL var in datascrapper.py to any another genre(ex: humor, insperation, hope, etc.) on the website and it should work.
